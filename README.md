# FraudShield: AI-Powered Fraud Detection for Digital Payments

> Helping Indian small businesses fight back against digital payment fraud — with privacy-first AI.

---

## 🧠 Introduction

With India's surge in digital payments, particularly UPI, small businesses face growing threats of fraud — but have no affordable defense tools. FraudShield is a lightweight, AI-powered solution that detects fraud using anonymized transactional data (PCA-transformed), making privacy a priority. This project was the **2nd runner-up** at [RACCAM Hackathon 1.0].

## ❗ The Problem (Rohan’s Story)

Meet **Rohan**, a 29-year-old small e-commerce shop owner from Jaipur.

- He accepts payments mostly via **UPI**, **Google Pay**, and **PhonePe**.
- His store uses a popular **payment gateway** that batches transaction logs monthly.
- One day, ₹37,000 vanished via three fraudulent UPI transactions.
- His **bank refused to take responsibility**, citing insufficient evidence.

**Rohan’s Frustration**: He gets **anonymized CSV reports** (with privacy-protected PCA-transformed fields) from his gateway, but **no tools** to check if anything looks suspicious.

**His Dream**: “Aap bas mujhe bata do kaunse transaction risky hai — aur main us customer ko blacklist kar dunga.”

**His Hesitation**: “I’m not a tech guy. Yeh V1-V28 kya hota hai? Mujhe sirf fraud se bachna hai.”

## 💡 What Makes It Different (USP)

- ✅ Works **even with anonymized (PCA) datasets**
- ✅ Designed for **non-technical users** (no jargon)
- ✅ Shows **only at-risk transactions**, not all data
- ✅ Provides **simple verdicts**: "Safe" or "Suspicious"
- ✅ Designed with **Bharat-first mindset**, not enterprise jargon
- ✅ Respects **data privacy laws** (GDPR, PCI DSS)

---

## 📦 File Format Requirements

Your CSV file should contain:
- Columns: `Time`, `V1–V28` (PCA), `Amount`
- Optional: `Class` (0 = safe, 1 = fraud) if doing analysis
- No missing values

**Note:** Future support will allow raw transaction data (merchant ID, device, location, etc.)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step User Flow

1. **Open app** → Simple welcome screen
2. **Upload file** (drag-and-drop or button)
3. **Click Predict** → Backend runs model
4. **Table View**: Only suspicious rows shown, sorted by fraud score
5. **Instructions panel**:
   - "What does this mean?"
   - "What should I do?"
   - "How to confirm with customer?"
6. **Download CSV**
7. **Take manual action**: Contact customer / freeze account / report to UPI partner

## 📘 Fraud Rulebook (to double-verify)

**Basic Risk Checklist:**

| Checkpoint                        | Recommended Action        |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| High fraud score (>0.8)          | Flag for review           |
| High Amount (>₹10,000)           | Cross-verify payment ID   |
| Frequent transactions in minutes | Pause & call customer     |
| Amount mismatch from usual value| Check past records        |
| Repeated failed UPI IDs          | Notify payment partner    |

Add this rulebook **in the UI as sidebar/toggle section**.

🔴 No user login/dashboard yet  
🔴 No real-time blocking or alerting  
🔴 No graph/identity fraud logic  
🔴 No explainability engine (coming soon)  
🔴 Model not auto-improving (no live retraining pipeline)
